# Kubernetes Tips and Best Practices

- **Namespace Usage**: Organize applications by using namespaces.
- **Resource Limits**: Always set resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers.
- **Monitor Health**: Use readiness and liveness probes for application health checks.
- **Storage Management**: Use Persistent Volumes (PV) for stateful applications.
- **Security**: Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for access control and avoid running containers as root.
