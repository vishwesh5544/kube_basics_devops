# Kubernetes Basics
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It helps in managing containerized applications across multiple hosts.

### Key Components:
- **Pods**: The smallest unit in Kubernetes.
- **Nodes**: Worker machines where Kubernetes deploys applications.
- **Cluster**: Collection of nodes managed by Kubernetes.
- **Deployments**: Manages the desired state for application workloads.
- **Services**: Exposes applications running on a set of Pods as a network service.

### Kubernetes Architecture:
Kubernetes has a master-slave architecture. The master manages the nodes, which execute the containers.
